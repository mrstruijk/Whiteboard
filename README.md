## Contributing

This is a package made possible by the great tutorial of [Justin P. Barnett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHE5ubsP-E8&t=1803s). I have added some extra features to the package, but the core of the package is his work. If you want to contribute to this package, please do so by forking the repository and making a pull request. I will review the pull request and merge it if it fits the package.
